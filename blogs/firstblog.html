<h3>First blog</h3>
<p>This is the first blog I write via github page, and actually this is really the first blog of mine.</p>
<p>I decide to record some knowledges which will not out of date. In my view, no matter how many new technology come out, but the backend theory will not change so much. So I will record some basic knowledge here to remind myself not remember the basic of the world!</p>
<p>Additionally, I write the code from html -> js, and for github page can only just hold frontend language(or I don't know which features can do this), so I did not implement the comments feature.</p>

<script>
  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
     (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
       m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
         })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

  ga('create', 'UA-57000339-1', 'auto');
    ga('send', 'pageview');
