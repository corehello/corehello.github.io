<h2 id="on-my-way-to-common-lisp">On my way to Common Lisp</h2>
<p>Common Lisp is a programming language, and the first functional programming language. It has a long history and can back track to early of last century. It come from Mathmatics(which is called lambda calculus invented by Alonzo Church). It is the second-oldest high-level language and can support nearly all paradigms today(actually we can say all paradigm can implemented by common Lisp). And has all complex data structure which other programming language supported in mordern life.</p>
<p>Common Lisp has powerful macros, so it can create a language layer over the common lisp. And language is a set of expressions, so it is called expression-oriented language and even language-oriented programming language. Common Lisp is widwspread used in AI(Artificial intelligence) research. And many concepts of other programming language come from common lisp, and Common lisp have many features which influenced many other languages.</p>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>Lisp was invented in 1958 by John McCarthy with the famous paper &quot;Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine, Part I&quot;. But the theory have already invented by Alozon Church who try to solve the computability theory for Hilbert's 10th problems. He invented the lambda calculus system on mathmatics, and Turing inventd Turing machine on computer hardware. So as we know, knowledges which based on mathmatics will never be out of date.</p>
<h3 id="why-i-learn-common-lisp">Why I learn Common lisp</h3>
<p>I have known common lisp when I was in unversity. But at that time, I am not dive into it, and from then on, I decide to know common lisp and even I have not a clear understand on it. And after I graguated, I was working on a boring software testing task. And I write automation testing based on cucumber-ruby and watir-webdriver(which is based on selenium-webdriver). When I focus on it, I found some issues need to be solved:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>write automation testing cases is boring and will spend too much time. so I want to write automation testing by program.</li>
<li>I have known many other programming language, python, ruby, perl, golang, c, java, c++, and those programming language have it's own syntax structure and paradigms. So I need to know why so many paradigms existed, and why huge differences existed in those language, I need to learn a language which have powerful ability, and support most of popular paradigms.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I turn to common lisp.</p>

<p>I am a begineer of common lisp, and still on my way to common lisp...</p>
